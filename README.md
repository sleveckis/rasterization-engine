# Rasterization Render Engine in C++
Engine written in C++ that accepts triangle primitives in an input file and renders as a PNG them via rasterization techniques. Utilizes Phong shading, hidden surface removal, and arbitrary camera positions. Requires CMake to be installed on the host machine to compile, which is considerably easiser to set up in *-NIX based systems than Windows.
